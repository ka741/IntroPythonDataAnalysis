**Companion Blog Posts**

The course is described in blog posts that can be found here https://medium.com/@ka741. This repo contains all the notebooks in the introduction to python for data analysis tutorial.There are several notebooks in the series, each stepping through an important part of the data analysis process.

**What data are we using?**

We will be using a dataset collected during the global pandemic. This data includes measures of social distancing and antisocial behavior. The original publication “Reduced social distancing early in the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with antisocial behaviors in an online United States sample” can be found here https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33412567/ and the csv file we will be using can be found here https://osf.io/4yp23/.

**What question are we trying to answer?**

Did people that are generally more antisocial (i.e. people that break the rules and are more physically and socially aggressive) leave their house more, violating government safety guidelines, during the global pandemic?

We can use publicly available data from the dataset above to answer this and plenty of other questions!

**Recommended order:**

1)	Exploratory Data Analysis
2)  Data Cleaning
